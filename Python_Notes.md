# What is Python?

Python is a general-purpose, dynammic, high-level and interpreted programming
language. It supports Object Oriented Programming approach to develop
applications.

It is simple and easy to learn and provides lots of high-level data structures.

We don't need to use data types to declare variable because it is dynamically
typed, so we can write a = 10 to assign an interger value in an interger
variable.

Python is an open-source, cost-free programming language.

In Python, code readability and maintability are important. As a result, even

## Python Tokens

- **Keywords**: Reserved words that have special meanings in Python. Eg -
  `False, None, True, and, as, assert, async, await, break, continue, del, except, finally, from, global, import, in, is, lambda, if, else, elif, for, while, def, class`
- **Identifiers**: name given to variables, functions, classes by the
  programmer. Must start with a letter or an underscore and can be followed by
  letters, numbers or underscores

  - can't start with number
  - can only contain alpha-numeric char and underscores `(A-z, 0-9, _)`
  - case-sensitive `(age, Age and AGE are three different vars)`
  - it can't be any of the python keyword

  Types of Literals:

  1. Numeric Literal
  2. String Literal
  3. Boolean Literal
  4. None Literal
  5. List Literal
  6. Tuple Literal
  7. Set Literal
  8. Dictionay Literal

- **Literals**: constant values in py. Eg `string, numbers and boolean`
- **Operators**: different operators like
  `arithmetic operators (+,-,*,/); comparision operator (==, !=, >=, <=)`
  - Arithmetic Operators
    - Addition `+`
    - Subtraction `-`
    - Division `/`
    - Modulus `%`
    - Exponent `**`
    - Floor Division `//`
  - Comparsion Operators
    - `==`
    - `!=`
    - `<=`
    - `>=`
  - Assignment Operators
    - `+=`
  - Bitwise Operators
  - Membership Operators
    - `in`
    - `not in`
  - Identify Operators
    - `is`
    - `is not`
  - Logical Operators
    - `and`
    - `or`
    - `not`

## Data Types

- We did not specify the type of variable a, which has the value five from an
  integer. The Python Interpreter will automatically interpret the variable as
  integer
- We can verify the type of the program-used variable thanks to Python. The
  type() function in Python returns the type of passed vairable.

### Python Data Types

- Numeric
  - Integer
  - Complex Number
  - Float
- Dictionary
- Boolean
- Set
- Sequence Type
  - Strings
  - List
  - Tuple

### Variables

- A variable is the name given to a memory location. A value-holding Python
  variable is also known as an identifier
- Python is an infer language that is smart enough to determine the type of a
  vairale, we don't need to specify its type in Python

### Type Casting

- Type casting in Python referes to the process of converting one data type into
  another. Python provides built-in functions for type casting:
  - `int()` : Converts a number or string to an integer
  - `float()` : Converts a number or string to an floating-point number
  - `str()` : Converts an object into a string representation
  - `bool()` : Converts a value to a Boolean (True or False) representation
  - `list()` : Converts a sequence (like a tuple or string) into a list
  - `tuple()` : Converts a sequence (like a list or string) into a tuple
  - `set()` : Converts a sequence (like a tuple or string) into a set
  - `dict()` : Creates a dictionary. Can take a sequence of key-value pairs or
    keyword arguments.

## Control Flow Statement

1. Conditional Statement:

   - `if`
   - `if-else`
   - `elif`

2. Looping Statements:

   - `for`
   - `while`

3. Loop Control Statements:
   - `break`
   - `continue`
   - `pass`
